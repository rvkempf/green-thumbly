# Welcome to Green Thumbly

Green Thumbly is a simple app for scheduling your garden, built using Remix. Simply enter your location, select the plants you want to grow, and Green Thumbly does the work to provide you with a personalized chart of planting and harvesting times that you can use for planning.

Currently this project is a WIP, but future plans include:

- Replacing the temporary, AI-generated plant data with real, accurate data
- Making the chart interactive and scalable
- Letting you modify the chart's recommended planting dates with your actual planting dates
- Incorporating current weather records and forecasts to improve temperature predictions
- Improving the theme and UI to not look like it was designed by a software engineer

## Dependencies

Install dependencies with npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install
```

This app also relies on the [ZipZoneFrostAPI](https://github.com/griggs333/ZipZoneFrostAPI).

## Development

First, start ZipZoneFrostAPI locally.

Then start the dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts the app in development mode on port 3000, rebuilding assets on file changes.
